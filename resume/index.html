                “There is a tide in the affairs of men.
                Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;<br>
                Omitted, all the voyage of their life<br>
                Is bound in shallows and in miseries.<br>
                On such a full sea are we now afloat,<br>
                And we must take the current when it serves,<br>
                Or lose our ventures.”<br>
                - Shakespeare, Julius Caesar</p>
